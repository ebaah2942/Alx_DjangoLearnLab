1. Implemented Security Measures
a. SSL/TLS Encryption
What We Did: Obtained and installed SSL/TLS certificates (via Let's Encrypt) to encrypt data transmitted between clients and the server. Configured the web server (Nginx/Apache) to enforce HTTPS.
Contribution: Protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by ensuring secure communication.
Potential Improvement: Consider using a paid SSL certificate for advanced features like extended validation (EV) or wildcard certificates for subdomains.
b. HTTP to HTTPS Redirection
What We Did: Configured web server rules to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
Contribution: Ensures all users access the application securely, eliminating the risk of data exposure over unsecured HTTP.
Potential Improvement: Test the redirection thoroughly to avoid infinite loops or accidental exclusion of URLs.
c. HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
What We Did: Enabled HSTS in Django (SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS, SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS, SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD) to enforce HTTPS at the browser level.
Contribution: Prevents browsers from making any insecure HTTP requests to the server.
Potential Improvement: Submit the application to the HSTS preload list for global HTTPS enforcement.
d. Secure Cookies
What We Did: Configured Django settings to enforce HTTPS for cookies (SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE, CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE).
Contribution: Protects sensitive session and CSRF tokens from being sent over insecure connections.
Potential Improvement: Add the SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY flag to prevent client-side scripts from accessing cookies.
e. Automatic Certificate Renewal
What We Did: Automated SSL certificate renewal using Certbotâ€™s cron jobs.
Contribution: Ensures uninterrupted HTTPS functionality by preventing certificate expiration.
Potential Improvement: Monitor renewal logs regularly to avoid unexpected issues.
2. Contributions to Application Security
Data Encryption: SSL/TLS ensures that all data exchanged between users and the application remains confidential and tamper-proof.
Secure Sessions: Protects user sessions and authentication tokens from interception over unsecured networks.
Compliance: Aligns with modern web security standards, improving user trust and satisfying regulatory requirements like GDPR.
Prevention of Attacks: Mitigates risks like session hijacking, CSRF, and MITM attacks.
3. Potential Areas for Improvement
a. Web Server Hardening
Disable unused protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0, 1.1) and weak ciphers in the web server configuration.
Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection.
b. Content Security Policy (CSP)
Define a CSP header to control resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating XSS attacks.
c. Security Headers
Add headers like X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy for additional protection.
d. Regular Security Audits
Conduct penetration testing and use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to identify vulnerabilities.
e. Backend Security
Review backend authentication/authorization mechanisms.
Enable database encryption and input sanitization to mitigate injection attacks.
