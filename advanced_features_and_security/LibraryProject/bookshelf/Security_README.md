Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
and other malicious content injection attacks by specifying which resources (such as scripts, styles, and images)
the browser should be allowed to load and execute.
CSRF protection is essential for securing web applications against malicious requests, 
and Django makes it easy to implement with built-in tools.
